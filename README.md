## Overview
VR-Knowledge-Base was a project done for HackDFW's 2022 hackathon, which won the Children Health's Hospital Sponsor Award.
Its purpose was to compile information about how to use VR technology for consumers and faculty in an easy and digestable format 
in order to speed the process of learning the new hardware quicker.  It was built with gitbook to allow for accessible and easily-formattable UI creation.
